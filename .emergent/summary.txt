The AI engineer successfully took over the project by first addressing mandatory configuration updates, then exploring the existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for wedding guest management. The initial application was a functional MVP. The main task evolved from integrating a new advanced table seating system, which involved extensive TypeScript conversion, Supabase integration, and bug fixing related to data synchronization, authentication, and UI modals. Subsequent requests focused on filtering guests/tables from the database, improving UI/UX by removing unnecessary labels, and adding advanced features like  selection for tables and an intelligent recommendation system. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, iteratively fixing issues like  in a sandboxed environment and persistent table visibility on the canvas after navigation. The work concluded with the integration of new advanced components for guest filters, smart suggestions, and a stats dashboard, with a pending task to ensure all UI components are correctly integrated.

<product_requirements>
The initial application, Sistema Matrimonio Perfetto, is a comprehensive wedding guest management system. It features an elegant landing page, guest management (add, track status, categorize, handle allergies), table organization, secure Supabase authentication, data export, a dashboard with statistics, and a responsive UI.

User requests and implemented features include:
1.  **Replace existing table section:** Integrate a new advanced table seating system () with an interactive drag-and-drop canvas, real-time occupancy, various table shapes, advanced guest assignment, and modern UI.
2.  **Filter confirmed guests:** The table section's guest list must only display guests or companions with  in the Supabase  table, replacing mock data.
3.  **Filter real tables and fix deletion:** Tables in the management section should only be those existing in the Supabase  table, replacing mock data. The table deletion button, which encountered a browser console error (), needs fixing.
4.  **UI cleanup:** Remove Confirmed labels (e.g., âœ… Confermato) from guest cards, headers, and statistics in the Tables section. Remove stage and dance floor elements from the table map for a minimalist layout.
5.  **Persistent table visibility:** Ensure tables loaded from the database appear and remain visible on the canvas after page navigation.
6.  **Table categories and side selection:** In the table filter dropdown, show only specific categories: Famiglia di lui, Famiglia di lei, Amici, and Colleghi. When creating tables, allow users to select a lato (side) and save it in the  column of the  table to diversify tables.
7.  **Advanced table section improvements:** Enhance the tables section by incorporating advanced features found in professional wedding table planners, such as advanced guest filters, intelligent seating recommendations, and a detailed statistics dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Tavoli (Tables) section of the application by integrating advanced features inspired by professional wedding table planners. This involved creating and integrating three new components into  within a tabbed interface:
1.  ****: For more sophisticated filtering options for guests.
2.  ****: To provide intelligent recommendations for seating arrangements.
3.  ****: To display a comprehensive dashboard of table-related statistics.

The integration into  involved modifying the  component to include new  elements for Filtri Avanzati, Suggerimenti Smart, and Statistiche. While integrating the , the engineer identified a missing  component that needs to be added to the UI kit. This is the immediate next step in the current task.

The  file has been significantly updated to incorporate these new components, wrapping them in appropriate  sections. The goal is to elevate the table management functionality to a more robust and feature-rich level.

<optional_next_step>
Check for the  component's existence in the UI kit and add it if missing.
